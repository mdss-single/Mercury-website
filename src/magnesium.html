					<p class="product__descr--big">Magnesium (Mg) is a group 2 period 3 chemical element of the periodic table.</p>
					<p>Magnesium is very common metal in nature having great biogenic significance for a human. Most of the extracted magnesium is used for production of magnesium structural alloys which are in high demand in aviation, motor-vehicle, chemical, refinery industry, instrument manufacture. Magnesium alloys differ by lightness, strength, high specific rigidity, good machinability. They are nonmagnetic, extract heat, have vibration resistance 20 times greater than alloy steel. Magnesium is widely used for production of some metals, for making better mechanical characteristics of steel and cast iron, for aluminium cleaning.</p>
					<p>Pure magnesium:<br>• 99.8%,<br>• 99.9%</p>
